## 1. What is a Simulator, Design, and Testbench?

###  Simulator

A **simulator** is a software tool that checks your digital circuit’s functionality by applying test inputs and viewing outputs. This helps you verify your design before hardware implementation.

###  Design

The **design** is your Verilog code describing the intended logic functionality.

###  Testbench

A **testbench** is a simulation environment that applies various inputs to your design and checks if the outputs are correct.

![Alt Text](Images/TestbenchFlow.png)

---

## 2. Getting Started with iverilog

**iverilog** is an open-source simulator for Verilog. Here’s the typical simulation flow:

![Alt Text](Images/IverilogFlow.jpeg)
- Both the design and testbench are provided as input to iverilog.
- The simulator produces a `.vcd` file for waveform viewing in GTKWave.

---

## 3. Lab: Simulating a 2-to-1 Multiplexer

Let’s simulate a simple **2-to-1 multiplexer** using iverilog!

###  Step 1: Clone the Workshop Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop/verilog_files
```

###  Step 2: Install Required Tools

```shell
sudo apt install iverilog
sudo apt install gtkwave
```

###  Step 3: Simulate the Design

Compile the design and testbench:

```shell
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
```

Run the simulation:

```shell
./a.out
```

View the waveform:

```shell
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
```

![Alt Text](Images/Multiplexer.jpg)

---

## 4. Verilog Code Analysis

**The code for the multiplexer (`good_mux.v`):**

```verilog
module good_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
always @ (*)
begin
    if(sel)
        y <= i1;
    else 
        y <= i0;
end
endmodule
```

###  **How It Works**

- **Inputs:** `i0`, `i1` (data), `sel` (select line)
- **Output:** `y` (registered output)
- **Logic:** If `sel` is 1, `y` gets `i1`; if `sel` is 0, `y` gets `i0`.

---

## 5. Introduction to Yosys & Gate Libraries

###  What is Yosys?

**Yosys** is a powerful open-source synthesis tool for digital hardware. It takes your Verilog code and converts it into a gate-level netlist—a hardware blueprint.

#### Yosys Features

- **Synthesis:** Converts HDL to a logic circuit
- **Optimization:** Improves speed or area
- **Technology Mapping:** Matches logic to actual hardware cells
- **Verification:** Checks correctness
- **Extensibility:** Supports custom flows

###  Why Do Libraries Have Different Gate "Flavors"?

A `.lib` file contains many versions of each gate (like AND, OR, NOT) with different properties:

- **Performance:** Faster gates for critical paths, slower for power savings
- **Power:** Some gates use less energy
- **Area:** Smaller gates for compact chips
- **Drive Strength:** Stronger gates to drive more load
- **Signal Integrity:** Specialized gates for noise/performance
- **Mapping:** Synthesis tools pick the best flavor for your needs

---

## 6. Synthesis Lab with Yosys

    ```

6. **Visualize the gate-level netlist**
    ```shell
    show
    ```

## Timing Libraries

### SKY130 PDK Overview

The SKY130 PDK is an open-source Process Design Kit based on SkyWater Technology's 130nm CMOS technology. It provides essential models and libraries for integrated circuit (IC) design, including timing, power, and process variation information.

### Decoding tt_025C_1v80 in the SKY130 PDK

- **tt**: Typical process corner.
- **025C**: Represents a temperature of 25°C, relevant for temperature-dependent performance.
- **1v80**: Indicates a core voltage of 1.8V.

This naming convention clarifies which process, voltage, and temperature conditions the library models.

---

### Opening and Exploring the .lib File

To open the sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib file:

1. **Install a text editor:**
   ```shell
   sudo apt install gedit
   ```
2. **Open the file:**
   ```shell
   gedit sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
   ```
 ![Alt Text](Images/OpeningAndExxploringTheFile.jpg)

---

## Hierarchical vs. Flattened Synthesis

### Hierarchical Synthesis

- **Definition**: Retains the module hierarchy as defined in RTL, synthesizing modules separately.
- **How it Works**: Tools like Yosys process each module independently, using commands such as `hierarchy` to analyze and set up the design structure.

**Advantages:**
- Faster synthesis time for large designs.
- Improved debugging and analysis due to maintained module boundaries.
- Modular approach, aiding integration with other tools.

**Disadvantages:**
- Cross-module optimizations are limited.
- Reporting can require additional configuration.

**Example:**
![Alt Text](Images/Hierarchicalvs.FlattenedSynthesis.jpg)
---

### Flattened Synthesis

- **Definition**: Merges all modules into a single flat netlist, eliminating hierarchy.
- **How it Works**: The `flatten` command in Yosys collapses the hierarchy, allowing whole-design optimizations.

**Advantages:**
- Enables aggressive, cross-module optimizations.
- Results in a unified netlist, sometimes simplifying downstream processes.

**Disadvantages:**
- Longer runtime for large designs.
- Loss of hierarchy complicates debugging and reporting.
- Can increase memory usage and netlist complexity.

**Example:**

![Alt Text](Images/FlattenedSynthesis.jpg)

> **Important:** Hierarchical synthesis maintains sub-modules in the design, while flattening produces a netlist from the ground up.

---

### Key Differences

| Aspect                | Hierarchical Synthesis             | Flattened Synthesis           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Hierarchy             | Preserved                          | Collapsed                    |
| Optimization Scope    | Module-level only                  | Whole-design                 |
| Runtime               | Faster for large designs           | Slower for large designs     |
| Debugging             | Easier (traces to RTL)             | Harder                       |
| Output Complexity     | Modular structure                  | Single, complex netlist      |
| Use Case              | Modularity, analysis, reporting    | Maximum optimization         |

## Flip-Flop Coding Styles

Flip-flops are fundamental sequential elements in digital design, used to store binary data. Below are efficient coding styles for different reset/set behaviors.

### Asynchronous Reset D Flip-Flop

```verilog
module dff_asyncres (input clk, input async_reset, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_reset)
    if (async_reset)
      q <= 1'b0;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```
- **Asynchronous reset**: Overrides clock, setting q to 0 immediately.
- **Edge-triggered**: Captures d on rising clock edge if reset is low.

### Asynchronous Set D Flip-Flop

```verilog
module dff_async_set (input clk, input async_set, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_set)
    if (async_set)
      q <= 1'b1;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```
- **Asynchronous set**: Overrides clock, setting q to 1 immediately.

### Synchronous Reset D Flip-Flop

```verilog
module dff_syncres (input clk, input async_reset, input sync_reset, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk)
    if (sync_reset)
      q <= 1'b0;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```
- **Synchronous reset**: Takes effect only on the clock edge.

## 1. Constant Propagation

In VLSI design, constant propagation is a compiler optimization technique used to replace variables with their constant values during synthesis. This can simplify design and enhance performance.

**How it works:**  
Constant propagation analyzes the design code to identify variables with constant values. These are replaced directly, allowing tools to simplify logic and reduce circuit size.

**Benefits:**
- **Reduced Complexity:** Simpler logic, smaller circuit.
- **Performance Improvement:** Faster execution and reduced delays.
- **Resource Optimization:** Fewer gates or flip-flops required.
![Alt Text](Images/ConstantPropagation.jpg)
---

## 2. State Optimization

State optimization refines finite state machines (FSMs) to improve efficiency in IC design. It reduces the number of states, optimizes encoding, and minimizes logic.

**How it is done:**
- **State Reduction:** Merge equivalent states using algorithms.
- **State Encoding:** Assign optimal codes to states.
- **Logic Minimization:** Use Boolean algebra or tools for compact equations.
- **Power Optimization:** Techniques like clock gating reduce dynamic power.

---

## 3. Cloning

Cloning duplicates a logic cell or module to optimize performance, reduce power, or improve timing by balancing load or reducing wire length.

**How it’s done:**
- Identify critical paths using analysis tools.
- Duplicate the target cell/module.
- Redistribute connections to balance load.
- Place and route the cloned cell.
- Verify improvement via timing and power analysis.

![Alt Text](Images/Cloning.jpg)
---

## 4. Retiming

Retiming is a design optimization technique that improves circuit performance by repositioning registers (flip-flops) without changing functionality.

**How it is done:**
1. **Graph Representation:** Model circuit as a directed graph.
2. **Register Repositioning:** Move registers to balance path delays.
3. **Constraints Analysis:** Maintain timing and functional equivalence.
4. **Optimization:** Adjust register positions to minimize clock period and optimize power.

---

## 5. Labs on Optimization

### Lab 1

Below is the Verilog code for Lab 1:

```verilog
module opt_check (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?b:0;
endmodule
```

**Explanation:**
- `assign y = a ? b : 0;` means:
  - If `a` is true, `y` is assigned the value of `b`.
  - If `a` is false, `y` is 0.

Follow the steps from [Day 1 Synthesis Lab](https://github.com/Ahtesham18112011/RTL_workshop/tree/main/Day_1#6-synthesis-lab-with-yosys) and add the following between `abc -liberty` and `synth -top`:
```shell
opt_clean -purge
```
![Alt Text](Images/Lab1.jpg)
---

### Lab 2

Verilog code:

```verilog
module opt_check2 (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?1:b;
endmodule
```

**Code Analysis:**
- Acts as a multiplexer:
  - `y = 1` if `a` is true.
  - `y = b` if `a` is false.
![Alt Text](Images/Lab2.jpg)
---

### Lab 3

Verilog code:

```verilog
module opt_check2 (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?1:b;
endmodule
```

**Functionality:**  
2-to-1 multiplexer; `y = a ? 1 : b` (outputs `1` when `a` is true, otherwise `b`).
![Alt Text](Images/Lab3.jpg)
---

### Lab 4

Verilog code:

```verilog
module opt_check4 (input a , input b , input c , output y);
 assign y = a?(b?(a & c ):c):(!c);
 endmodule
```

**Functionality:**
- Three inputs (`a`, `b`, `c`), output `y`.
- Nested ternary logic:
  - If `a = 1`, `y = c`.
  - If `a = 0`, `y = !c`.
- Logic simplifies to:  
  `y = a ? c : !c`
![Alt Text](Images/Lab4.jpg)
---

### Lab 5

Verilog code:

```verilog
module dff_const1(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else
		q <= 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```

**Functionality:**
- D flip-flop with:
  - Asynchronous reset to 0
  - Loads constant `1` when not in reset
![Alt Text](Images/Lab5.jpg)
---

### Lab 6

Verilog code:

```verilog
module dff_const2(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		q <= 1'b1;
	else
		q <= 1'b1;
end
endmodule
```

**Functionality:**
- D flip-flop always sets output `q` to `1` (regardless of reset or clock).
![Alt Text](Images/Lab6.jpg)
---

## Summary

# Day 4: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS), Blocking vs. Non-Blocking in Verilog, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

Welcome to Day 4 of the RTL Workshop! Today’s session focuses on three essential topics in digital design:

- **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)**
- **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog**
- **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch**

You’ll learn both the theory and practical implications, complete with hands-on labs to reinforce your understanding.

## 1. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

**GLS** stands for **Gate-Level Simulation**. It is a critical verification step in the VLSI design flow where the synthesized gate-level netlist of a digital circuit is simulated to validate:

- Functional correctness
- Timing behavior
- Power estimates
- Test structures (e.g., scan chains for DFT)

### Why Perform GLS?

- **Synthesis Validation**: Ensures that synthesis tools faithfully translate RTL into gates.
- **Timing Verification**: Simulates with realistic delays (from SDF files), allowing you to check for timing violations (e.g., setup/hold errors).
- **Testability**: Confirms that scan chains and other test features work post-synthesis.

### When is GLS Performed?

- **After synthesis**: Once the RTL is converted into a gate-level netlist.
- **Before physical design**: To catch issues early, before layout.

### Types of GLS

- **Functional GLS**: Logic-only simulation, often with zero or unit delays.
- **Timing GLS**: Uses annotated timing data to check real-world timing behavior.

---

## 2. Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch

A **synthesis-simulation mismatch** occurs when the simulation results of RTL (pre-synthesis) do not match simulation results of the gate-level netlist (post-synthesis) or hardware. Reasons include:

- **Non-synthesizable constructs**: Use of delays, initial blocks, or other code not supported by synthesis.
- **Incomplete or ambiguous coding**: E.g., missing `else` clauses, improper sensitivity lists.
- **Tool interpretation differences**: Simulation and synthesis tools may interpret ambiguous RTL differently.

**Key Point:** Always write synthesizable, unambiguous RTL and follow good coding practices to minimize mismatches.

---

## 3. Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog

Verilog offers two types of procedural assignments:

### 3.1 Blocking Statements (`=`)

- **Syntax:** `=`
- **Execution:** Sequential, executes immediately.
- **Suitable for:** Combinational logic (e.g., `always @(*)`).
- **Example:**  
  ```verilog
  always @(*) y = a & b;
  ```

### 3.2 Non-Blocking Statements (`<=`)

- **Syntax:** `<=`
- **Execution:** Scheduled, executes concurrently at the end of the time step.
- **Suitable for:** Sequential logic (e.g., `always @(posedge clk)`).
- **Example:**  
  ```verilog
  always @(posedge clk) q <= d;
  ```

### 3.3 Comparison Table

| **Blocking (`=`)**                        | **Non-Blocking (`<=`)**                   |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Uses `=` operator                         | Uses `<=` operator                         |
| Sequential, immediate execution           | Concurrent, scheduled at end of timestep   |
| Updates happen instantly in code order    | Updates applied after time step            |
| For combinational logic, temp variables   | For sequential logic, registers/flip-flops |
| Infers combinational logic (gates)        | Infers sequential logic (flip-flops)       |

## 4. Labs

### Lab 1: Ternary Operator MUX

Verilog code for a simple 2:1 multiplexer using a ternary operator:

```verilog
module ternary_operator_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output y);
  assign y = sel ? i1 : i0;
endmodule
```
- **Function:** `y = i1` if `sel = 1`; else `y = i0`.
![Alt Text](Images/TernaryOperatorMUX,jpg)
---

### Lab 2: Synthesis Using Yosys

Synthesize the above MUX using Yosys.  
_Follow the standard Yosys synthesis flow._

![Alt Text](Images/SynthesisUsingYosys.jpg)
---

### Lab 3: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) of MUX

Run GLS for the synthesized MUX.  
Use this command (adjust paths as needed):

```shell
iverilog /path/to/primitives.v /path/to/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v ternary_operator_mux.v testbench.v
```

![Alt Text](Images/ Gate-LevelSimulation(GLS)ofMUX.jpg)

---

### Lab 4: Bad MUX Example (Common Pitfalls)

Verilog code with intentional issues:

```verilog
module bad_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
  always @ (sel) begin
    if (sel)
      y <= i1;
    else 
      y <= i0;
  end
endmodule
```

#### Issues:
- **Incomplete sensitivity list**: Should include `i0`, `i1`, and `sel`.
- **Non-blocking assignment in combinational logic**: Should use blocking assignments (`=`).

**Corrected version:**
```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  if (sel)
    y = i1;
  else
    y = i0;
end
```

![Alt Text](Images/BadMUXExample.jpg)

---

### Lab 5: GLS of Bad MUX

Perform GLS on the `bad_mux`.  
Expect simulation mismatches or warnings due to above issues.

![Alt Text](Images/GLSofBadMUX.jpg)

---

### Lab 6: Blocking Assignment Caveat

Verilog code:

```verilog
module blocking_caveat (input a, input b, input c, output reg d);
  reg x;
  always @ (*) begin
    d = x & c;
    x = a | b;
  end
endmodule
```

#### What’s wrong?
- The order of assignments causes `d` to use the old value of `x`—not the newly computed value.
- **Best Practice:** Assign intermediate variables before using them.

**Corrected order:**
```verilog
always @ (*) begin
  x = a | b;
  d = x & c;
end
```

## 5. Summary

- **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS):** Validates netlist functionality, timing, and testability after synthesis.
- **Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch:** Avoid by using synthesizable, unambiguous RTL code.
- **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking:** Use blocking (`=`) for combinational, non-blocking (`<=`) for sequential logic.
- **Labs:** Reinforce key concepts and highlight common RTL pitfalls.

---

> [!TIP]
>  Always simulate both your RTL and gate-level netlist, and review warnings from synthesis and simulation tools!

## 1. If-Else Statements in Verilog

**If-else statements** are used for conditional execution in behavioral modeling, typically within procedural blocks (`always`, `initial`, tasks, or functions).

### Syntax

```verilog
if (condition) begin
    // Code block executed if condition is true
end else begin
    // Code block executed if condition is false
end
```

- **condition**: An expression evaluating to true (non-zero) or false (zero).
- **begin ... end**: Used to group multiple statements. Omit if only one statement is present.
- The `else` part is optional.

#### Nested If-Else

```verilog
if (condition1) begin
    // Code for condition1 true
end else if (condition2) begin
    // Code for condition2 true
end else begin
    // Code if no conditions are true
end
```

---

## 2. Inferred Latches in Verilog

**Inferred latches** occur when a combinational logic block does not assign a value to a variable in all possible execution paths. This causes the synthesis tool to infer a latch, which may not be the designer’s intention.

### Example of Latch Inference

```verilog
module ex (
    input wire a, b, sel,
    output reg y
);
    always @(a, b, sel) begin
        if (sel == 1'b1)
            y = a; // No 'else' - y is not assigned when sel == 0
    end
endmodule
```

**Problem**: When `sel` is 0, `y` is not assigned, so a latch is inferred.

#### Solution: Add Else or Default Case

```verilog
module ex (
    input wire a, b, sel,
    output reg y
);
    always @(a, b, sel) begin
        case(sel)
            1'b1 : y = a;
            default : y = 1'b0; // Default assignment
        endcase
    end
endmodule
```

## 4. For Loops in Verilog

A **for loop** is used within procedural blocks (`initial`, `always`, tasks/functions) to execute statements multiple times based on a loop counter.

### Syntax

```verilog
for (initialization; condition; increment) begin
    // Statements to execute
end
```

- Must be inside procedural blocks.
- Synthesizable only if the number of iterations is fixed at compile time.

#### Example: 4-to-1 MUX Using a For Loop

```verilog
module mux_4to1_for_loop (
    input wire [3:0] data, // 4 input lines
    input wire [1:0] sel,  // 2-bit select
    output reg y           // Output
);
    integer i;
    always @(data, sel) begin
        y = 1'b0; // Default output
        for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin
            if (i == sel)
                y = data[i];
        end
    end
endmodule
```

---

## 5. Generate Blocks in Verilog

A **generate block** is used to create hardware structures such as module instances or logic at compile time. Typically used with `for` loops and the `genvar` keyword.

#### Example

```verilog
genvar i;
generate
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin : gen_loop
        and_gate and_inst (.a(in[i]), .b(in[i+1]), .y(out[i]));
    end
endgenerate
```

## 6. What is an RCA (Ripple Carry Adder)?

An RCA adds binary numbers using a chain of full adders. To add `n` bits, you need `n` full adders. Each carry-out connects to the carry-in of the next stage.

assign i_int = {i3, i2, i1, i0};
integer k;
always @(*) begin
    for (k = 0; k < 4; k = k + 1) begin
        if (k == sel)
            y = i_int[k];
    end
end
endmodule

---

## Summary

- Use complete if-else and case statements to avoid unintended latch inference.
- For loops and generate blocks are powerful for writing scalable, synthesizable code.
- Always ensure every signal is assigned in every possible execution path for combinational logic.
- Use labs to reinforce concepts with practical Verilog code and synthesis results.
